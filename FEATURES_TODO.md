## Architecture Notes üèóÔ∏è
The diary now uses a modular architecture with:
- **VersionManagerService**: Handles delta compression and version management
- **AppDataService**: Application logic abstraction layer
- **StorageProvider Interface**: Allows easy swapping between storage backends
- **GoogleSheetsStorageProvider**: Current implementation using Google Sheets API

This makes it easy to add new storage providers (Notion, Firebase, etc.) without changing the core application logic.
